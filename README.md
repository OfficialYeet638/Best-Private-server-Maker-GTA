***How to use:***

1. Go to https://www.videolan.org/vlc/, download VLC player. (Skip this step if you already have VLC player installed in your computer.)

2. Go to Release, download the latest version

3. For **Rickroll_flash_troll.exe**: Since the name maybe suspicious, so after download it, ***change the filename to something else***. For example, if your friend            want some paid apps but he can't buy it at this moment, then name it to "*xxxx_installer*" (where *xxxx* is the app name).

   For **Google.Chrome.exe**: rename it to **Google Chrome.exe** (just change the **.** to space) Then, go to **Properties**, check the **"Unblock"** box next to          Security. (Shown in the image below)
